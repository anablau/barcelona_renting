# Barcelona_Renting_Prices

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]


## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze the renting prices in Barcelona per neighborhood between 2015 and 2020. Furthermore, is being described if we could use a prediction model according to the features we have in the dataset.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Correlation Matrix


### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Lab
* Pandas


## Project Description
* Data Source: https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/est-mercat-immobiliari-lloguer-mitja-mensual


Markup : * Some questions being explored in this dataset are
              * How the average renting price per m2 is developing per year?
              * How the average renting monthly price is developing per year?
              * Which are the most expensive and cheapest neighborhoods?
              * With the given features in this dataset, is it possible to develop a Machine Learning Model predicting the renting price?

* Challengers: The current features do not have a strong correlation with the target variable (price) in order to build a high accurate prediction model.
